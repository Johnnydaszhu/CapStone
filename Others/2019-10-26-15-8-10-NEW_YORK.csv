Business Intelligence Analyst,,0,,,,"Here’s the thing—we hate traditional job descriptions. In our experience, they’re a terrible representation of what a job really entails and never paint a true picture of what it’s like to work at an organization.

That’s why, at Fundera, we do things differently. Instead of presenting you with some run-of-the-mill job description, we offer potential candidates our Job Spotlights. This gives us a chance to tell you the story of us, why you should work here, and what the role is really like.

Who’s Fundera and Why Should I Care?

Fundera is the go-to, financial resource for small businesses. We’re here to help entrepreneurs achieve their financial goals and grow businesses as big as their aspirations.

As a catalyst for smart financial decisions, our combination of proprietary technology and financial expertise provides business owners with tailored solutions based on their unique needs and eligibility—helping them prosper, create more jobs, and, ultimately, grow the economy.

Armed with one of the most experienced and passionate leadership teams in the business and backed by the industry’s leading investors, we’ve made a big impact on Main Street in just a short amount of time (Fundera launched in 2014 and has helped 35,000+ small businesses find their best financial solutions and secure over $1 billion in funding).

We’re experiencing massive growth year over year, and our impact on America’s job creators grows with us. We’re looking to further our impact and need incredible, ambitious, mission-oriented people to get there.

If you want to make a difference, if you want to create a workplace and life you love, and if you want to learn more and grow faster than you will at any other point in your career, you should keep reading.

What Is It Like to Work Here?

The easiest way to answer this is to check out our great rating on Glassdoor, take a deep dive into a few of our employee profiles, or look into some of our recent awards, like Crain’s Best Places to Work. Also, don’t forget to peep our Instagram.

For more detail, though, here are a few of our favorite things:
1. We want people who elevate the game - and offer meaningful equity in our fast-growing company to compensate for top performers.
2. We offer generous medical, dental, and vision insurance—you shouldn’t have to stress about your health. (And less stress makes you healthier, right?!)
3. Yes, your Fundera family is very important, but yours at home matters most. That’s why we offer incredibly generous maternity and paternity leave, have a family-friendly office, and love nothing more than seeing our Fundera kiddos at company events and socials.
4. Everybody needs a little R&R—but we want our team to have more than just a little. You’ll get flexible PTO and we mean legitimately flexible PTO.
5. We sponsor regular catered lunches with really cool speakers (like the founders of Birchbox, CityRow, and Percolate). We also regularly host company happy hours, and other events such as employee-led trivia and visits to customers. It’s important to bring our team together as much as possible.
6. Transparency is what our product is built on—and so is our culture. Whether that means regular all-hands meetings, board decks circulated every month, or a highly-accessible leadership team, we’re all stakeholders in this company and never forget that.

Ultimately, at Fundera, you get to come to work with a group of supportive, talented, ambitious individuals who will teach you something new every day, whilst building a product that will truly and actually change the lives of America’s small businesses and job creators. We think it’s pretty cool, and think you will, too.

Is This Role Right for Me?

The Business Intelligence Analyst will help Fundera make better data-driven decisions and improve business outcomes through actionable, insightful data analysis and visualization. The analyst will be the central fulcrum for company performance data leveraging existing KPI reporting and dashboards as well as building out additional tools to surface new insights and empower stakeholders throughout the organization.

As Our Business Intelligence Analyst, You'll Get to...
Help Fundera as an organization reach a higher, and unified, understanding of our data by joining at the foundational point of Fundera’s BI function. You’ll provide insight into company-wide trends by owning regular operational performance reporting and ad hoc analysis to dig into trends or new opportunities. You’ll help identify and deep dive into areas of interest across the full funnel and present findings in a way that’s easily digestible and actionable.
Democratize access to reporting and data at Fundera by building on and maintaining our Looker instance focused on company-wide dashboards as well as coordination with each to function to build the reports and dashboards they need to make strategic business decisions. This will include developing Looker models, explores, and dashboards to serve use-cases for existing data streams as well as additional builds for newly integrated data sources. We’re in the early stages of building out Looker and you’ll get to come on the ground floor with the opportunity to make a significant impact.
Make our data more actionable by making it more comprehensive. Work with the data team and various functional teams to continually develop and refine our data capture processes, the scope of data sources, and warehouse infrastructure to lay the foundation for reliable and accurate reporting.
Enable self-service within functional teams by spreading and supporting best practices across groups. You’ll be responsible for assisting with functional reporting by being a point of contact for embedded analysts within groups, or a supplement when an analytical function for that group doesn’t exist.
We're Looking for People Who Have...
2-3 years of experience working with large data sets to extract and surface actionable findings either in a business intelligence or functional analyst role.
Looker/SQL expert. Able to develop in LookML and build models, explores, and dashboards across a wide range of use cases. Can use SQL to debug Looker and run queries directly against our data warehouse.
An understanding of database/warehouse design and ETL infrastructure
Working knowledge of relevant business concepts - conversion funnels, cohort performance, churn, outcomes of product experimentation, what a b2b sales process looks like, etc.
Familiarity with statistical concepts to predict outcomes / test correlation
Experience using Salesforce (not required, but helpful)

Senior Data Analyst,,0,,,,"Company Description

What’s your favorite small business? The dog walker, corner bakery, dry cleaner down the block? We each rely on those businesses because they take care of us. At Attune, we look out for them.


Running a small business is hard. Getting insurance for your small business is even harder. It takes forever, the process is antiquated, and one wrong decision can be disastrous.


At Attune, we’re changing small business insurance in a big way.


At the forefront of the insurtech industry, we are rebuilding small business’s access to insurance from scratch, making it instant, easy, and safe. How? Instead of requiring that a business answers hundreds of questions (seriously), our sophisticated platform aggregates the necessary data from different sources, and then uses incredibly advanced analytics to create tailored products that can be delivered in mere minutes, not days or weeks.


We are at the beginning of our journey and are looking for innovators who are curious and excited to drive change.


Backed by Two Sigma, AIG, and Hamilton Insurance Group, we have the horsepower and partners to make a big impact. Unlike other start-ups, Attune has the funding, expertise, and support to modernize and move quickly. If you are energized by making the complex, simple; the time consuming, easy; and the antiquated, tech-enabled, we want you on our team.


Disrupting an industry through data, technology and speed isn't easy – but the challenges we’ll tackle together are some of the most rewarding you’ll experience in your career.

Job Description

You will join a growing analytics team in supporting Attune’s leadership in making strategic decisions by means of creating, visualizing and communicating the key metrics that impact the business. You will partner with the product, revenue and underwriting functions within Attune in understanding and quantifying the performance of key initiatives, distribution channels and products.


Responsibilities include:
Understanding conversion through our sales funnel and what trends and dynamics are impacting its efficacy (Who is buying what kinds of insurance? Is this changing over time? Why?)
Understanding the makeup of the portfolio of small businesses we insure and what facets and behaviors of those small businesses drive their performance
Working with the rest of the analytics team on data systems architecture with a view to data consistency and robustness
Assisting management with quick analyses to validate and invalidate hypotheses as well as a variety of ad-hoc reporting for dissemination internally and to the board
Helping to analyze the value of strategic partnerships and setting up financial metrics (e.g cost-per-quote) as part of the deal making process
Being a subject matter expert with reporting and quick analysis tools and being a guide to others in the organization to reach a level of self sufficiency
Qualifications
5+ years experience working in an analytics or data focused role, preferably within a smaller to medium sized organization. You are responsible for data quality and reporting, representing insights to stakeholders, and providing thought leadership on data and analytics best practices in your current role.
Proficiency with common data reporting tools and languages, including fluency with SQL, a working knowledge of Python, and expertise in data visualization platforms such as Tableau or Looker.
Relevant work experience creating and managing reporting and monitoring for a product, line of business or program, including both a deep understanding of the underlying data structures and communication to senior leadership.
Bachelor’s degree in Finance, Mathematics, Economics or a closely related quantitative field
Traits for success:
You communicate clearly and take a user-centric approach to creating reports and visualizations, i.e., you can anticipate the proficiency and interpretation of the consumers of your reports.
You are quick with numbers and back-of-the-envelope calculations.
You can smell-check numbers in reports, and have a good memory for reference numbers (e.g. last quarter's sales, daily application volume).
You are excited to work with programmers and data scientists to constantly improve the integrity and automation of your work.
You are well organized and can handle many unrelated requests without losing track of them.
You can use software to organize your activities when needed.
You have exceptional written and verbal communication skills.
You are a hands-on problem solver who is comfortable with ambiguity and loves a fast-paced environment.
You have strong interpersonal skills and are capable of building relationships to drive success.

About Us
Our nation's history of racism and oppression have led to inequities across sectors of society, including education, leaving millions of students—including an overwhelming number of students of color and low-income students—unprepared for college, career, and life. While research shows that classroom teachers are the single most important in-school factor in improving student achievement, their diverse voices are consistently left out of education policy decisions. For far too long, teachers have been treated as subjects of change rather than as agents of change.

Founded by public school teachers, Educators for Excellence is a growing movement of over 34,000 educators, united around a common set of values and principles for improving student learning and elevating the teaching profession. We work together to identify issues that impact our schools, create solutions to these challenges, and advocate for policies and programs that give all students access to a quality education.

What We Do
Our Theory of Change is grounded in two long-term goals that are inextricably linked: better outcomes for our students and the elevation of the quality and prestige of the teaching profession. We achieve this by:
Building a movement of forward-thinking teachers through grassroots organizing in communities across the country
Identifying and training teacher leaders within that broader movement to take on key positions of influence in their schools, districts, states, and perhaps most importantly, within their teachers unions
Creating teacher-led policy recommendations in order to bridge the divide between policymakers and the classroom
Advocating for implementation of teacher-generated policy ideas
Scaling this model to reach critical mass in the communities we serve and across the country

Educators for Excellence envisions an equitable and excellent education system that provides all students the opportunity to succeed and elevates the teaching profession.

The Opportunity
Reporting to the National Senior Manager of Data, the Data Associate (DA) is part data detective and part strategic advisor and must be a proactive, detail-oriented critical thinker who is able to build strong partnerships with others. The DA will work in partnership with national and chapter team members to help them understand and use data as a tactical and strategic tool. The DA will do this by working directly with teams to help them aggregate and interpret their data, performing in-depth analysis of data from internal and external sources, and communicating what we learn through data analysis to relevant team members. Eventually, the DA will turn actionable insights into models and scores that support better resource allocation and decision-making. Additionally, the DA will work with other members of the data team to support overall organizational data management, including support and training on the use of Salesforce and other data systems.
Responsibilities

Assist in the development of data-related standard operating procedures and guidance
Work with national and chapter team members to ensure alignment of data-related terminology and practices

Requirement(s):
1-2 years experience analyzing and reporting data
Advanced proficiency in Excel
Strong written and verbal communication skills
Strong critical thinking skills and an acute attention to detail

Respect and Professionalism: We act with personal responsibility, respect, and commitment to high quality work, to our organization and to each other
Solutions Orientation: We consistently approach even the most complex challenges with positivity, proactive solutions, and the assumption of best intentions
Growth Mindset: We intentionally create opportunities to develop ourselves and others in order to learn and continuously improve
Dynamic Leadership: We courageously take ownership, empower others, set bold visions, think strategically, and adapt to change
Diversity and Inclusiveness: Educational inequity is linked to race, power, and privilege, and so we take action to shift this paradigm by reflecting on our own identities, creating an inclusive and diverse community, and leveraging our differences as strengths
Benefits and Salary
Educators for Excellence believes in providing employees with benefits to support self-care, wellness, and financial stability. We value the whole person and provide benefits such as; paid time off, health insurance plans, competitive salaries that include pre-tax benefits, and cell phone reimbursements.

More About Us

BeenVerified was founded in New York by Josh Levy and Ross Cohen in 2007. At the time their mission was to provide easy and affordable access to public records.

Since then their mission has expanded to developing products and services that grant access to information and data across a number of verticals. In service of this mission, BeenVerified has launched multiple consumer brands including BeenVerified, NumberGuru, PeopleLooker, NeighborWho, and Ownerly.

In today's ever-changing world, filled with fake news, deception and a lack of transparency, we believe equal access to unbiased data and information can allow our customers to empower and protect themselves. Our mission is to develop a diverse portfolio of technologies, products, and services, that gives that access to all people.

About IPA
Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is a research and policy nonprofit that discovers and promotes effective solutions to global poverty problems. IPA brings together researchers and decision-makers to design, rigorously evaluate, and refine these solutions and their applications, ensuring that the evidence created is used to improve the lives of the world’s poor. In recent decades, trillions of dollars have been spent on programs designed to reduce global poverty, but clear evidence on which programs succeed is rare, and when evidence does exist, decision-makers often do not know about it. IPA exists to bring together leading researchers and these decision-makers to ensure that the evidence we create leads to tangible impact on the world. Since its founding in 2002, IPA has worked with over 575 leading academics to conduct over 650 evaluations in 51 countries. This research has informed hundreds of successful programs that now impact millions of individuals worldwide.

"Research Analyst, GJNY",3.3,0,Vera Institute of Justice,9,"Brooklyn, NY 11232","Please note that there are two openings for Research Analyst position in GJNY that require different qualifications and responsibilities, and make sure you apply for the right position you would like to pursue.

The Research Analyst in this role will work collaboratively with GJNY staff to conduct qualitative research, including court observations, focus groups, interviews among other responsibilities.

Who We Are
The Vera Institute of Justice, founded in 1961, envisions a society that respects the dignity of every person and safeguards justice for everyone.

We study problems that impede human dignity and justice.
We pilot solutions that are at once transformative and achievable.
We engage diverse communities in informed debate.
We harness the power of evidence to drive effective policy and practice.

We work with others who share our vision to tackle the most pressing injustices of our day—from mass incarceration, racial disparities, and the loss of public trust in law enforcement to the unmet needs of the vulnerable, the marginalized, and those harmed by crime and violence. Vera has offices in New York City, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and New Orleans. Vera is an equal opportunity employer with a commitment to diversity in the workplace—specifically, we value diverse experiences with regard to educational background and justice system contact. We hire employees that reflect our values: respect, independence, collaboration, and commitment.

Greater Justice New York
The Vera Institute of Justice is an independent, nonprofit organization that combines expertise in research, technical assistance, and policy to transform the systems people rely on for justice and safety. We envision a society that respects the dignity of every single person and are fighting to realize this every day. Our priorities are to secure equal justice, end mass incarceration, and strengthen families and communities around the country.
We are looking for a researcher to join our Greater Justice New York (GJNY) team. GJNY was launched as an interdisciplinary effort to tackle the drivers of mass criminalization and mass incarceration in New York. New York State is a microcosm of the landscape of incarceration across our country—arrests and the number of people in jail in large, urban areas like New York City are declining while a quiet but significant incarceration boom is under way in more rural, less populated parts of the state. We use research, policy, and advocacy to shine a light on injustices in all areas of the state and in all aspects of the criminal system—from bail to sentencing, parole, fines and fees, and more—and drive change through piloting innovative solutions and providing technical assistance. Our vision is a leaner, fairer, and more effective justice system where incarceration is the last resort, not the default, across all 62 counties of New York State.

What you'll be working on
New York State recently passed a historic set of reforms to our existing bail laws that go into effect on January 1, 2020. These reforms have the potential to transform many aspects of the criminal system, especially the bail decisions made in the courts and the number of people in jail pretrial. An evaluation of the process in which the new bail laws are implemented in local practices and their impact on local communities are key to identifying next steps of the reform. We are hiring a research analyst to play a key role in an ambitious, three-year evaluation study of these reforms, with a focus on six counties outside of New York City. The goal of our project is to document how the new bail laws are implemented, measure their impact on local communities, and examine any challenges to successful implementation and unintended consequences that arise.

Who you are
You are passionate about social and racial justice, motivated to drive change, and unafraid to challenge the status quo. You are enthusiastic, collaborative, curious, and kind. You have excellent chops in qualitative research and are willing to be nimble and work across multiple projects, often at the same time. The idea of working on a team of people who come from diverse backgrounds and perspectives inspires you. You either know New York State (and not just New York City) well, or you are truly excited to get to know all corners of our state. You care deeply about racial equity—in your research, your work, with your colleagues, and around the office.

In this role, you will:
Work collaboratively with GJNY staff to conduct qualitative research, including court observations, focus groups, and interviews;
Collect, clean, maintain, and analyze data;
Assist in managing research engagements with local justice system agencies, community members, and people who are directly impacted by the criminal system;
Assist in the design and deployment of data collection instruments and surveys;
Assist with grant proposal preparation;
Conduct literature reviews and distil key findings into memos; and
Assist in other GJNY projects and tasks.

What qualifications do you need?
Bachelor's degree in social science including but not limited to sociology, criminal justice, history, criminology, public policy, and two years of relevant work experience; or a Master's degree in a related discipline;
Experience in qualitative research including designing and conducting interviews, focus groups, and observations;
Experience with a statistical analysis package, such as Stata or R;
Excellent writing skills;
Ability to be flexible, multi-task, prioritize, and manage multiple activities in a fast-paced environment;
Interest in working with program and research staff in Vera's strongly collaborative, multi-disciplinary environment;
Ability to work effectively with a diverse array of people and positions, including government officials, criminal justice system personnel, practitioners, people who are directly impacted by the CJ system; and
Interest and excitement to travel frequently outside of New York City.

 When you join our team
You can expect to work with a team of amazing people who have tenacity, are creative, scrappy, and are committed to getting the work done. Why? Because our work is urgent, impactful, and more important than ever.
You can count on doing solutions-oriented and policy-driven research that is innovative and fulfilling. We ask difficult questions and entertain unconventional answers so we can reckon with the uncomfortable truths of our work.
You will have a gym membership you can't turn down, great benefits, and work-life balance. Driving meaningful change is hard work. But we also know that you have a life, places to go, and people to see.

About the job
Whether you're on a consumer product (like Gmail, Search, Maps, Chrome, Android) or a business product (Google Ads, AdSense, Google Marketing Platform, Analytics), you take part in a complete marketing experience as you lead every facet of the product's journey. From determining positioning, naming, competitive analysis, feature prioritization and external communications, you help shape the voice of the product and help it grow a consumer base. This means you work with a cross-functional team across Sales, corporate communications, legal, webmasters, product development, engineering and more. In this role, you'll be involved with product marketing strategy from beginning to end.

You possess exceptional research skills and can address a wide range of consumer and brand problems.

You are innately curious, collaborative, and can think about the big picture, nail execution and be forward thinking.

Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems-from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can-changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.
